# goatproxy
This is an AWS Lambda function to be served via AWS API Gateway,
to convert the feed of [my g.o.a.t. blog](https://kuropen.goat.me/) into JSON format.

This program is very simple because there is a [library](https://github.com/mmcdole/gofeed) to parse a feed.
So this repository is in the public domain.
